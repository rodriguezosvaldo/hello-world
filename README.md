# hello-world
This repo is part of the Code Louisville prework.
I'm a 33 years old guy from Cuba with one dream and a lot of will. 
I'm currently studying Programming at JCTC and developing some basic Python projects.
Studying at Code Louisville is an amazing opportunity I have been waiting for, this is 
a great Project that help people like me to get into tech. 
I'll do my best to make the mentors proud of my code!!!
